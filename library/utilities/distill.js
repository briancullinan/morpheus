There are already code analysis tools out there, what
makes this so special.

TODO: copy `just the tip` script from git.ipynb.
  this shows a code repository in the 3D engine
  except the code has been automatically feature branched
  squashed and remerged in virtual .git index based 
  on file-system "glob" paths.

TODO: temporal-merge, 3D merging tools where every 
  commit is automatically checked out, merged, or
  conflicted code is tried at a different time and
  every iteration is processed by a web-worker-based CI
  build-system.

Those are the obvious use cases for code analysis.
But by using the language processing tools that come
with the REPL service, I should be able...

TODO: highlight the lines of code / llib files being used
for an entire program as it's evaluating by REPL.

TODO: convert entire REST API documentations from their 
well-formatted state + existing library in say Rust-only.
And convert the entire thing to a Google style export
with library bindings in 10 different supported programming
languages. And then use puppetteer to submit a PR for
the framework as a bonus.

TODO: convert the entirety of beloved https://www.djangoproject.com/
to NodeJS and call it JDango, like the generalized 
C2Rust or PHP2JS transpilers of old.
https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-preset-php
AND

^^^ cool stuff that makes me excited to be a programmer.

TODO: combine with patterns.js and frameworks.js 
to undo the work that mocha.js generates, for example:
*/

describe('zuora oauth', () => {
    
    afterEach(() => {
        sandbox.restore();
    })
    
    it('should connect to zuora using oauth', () => {
    })
})

// should be converted back into:

({
select: 'SELECT * FROM Accounts',
callout: createBulkExportJob
})

// AND:

({
select: 'SELECT * FROM Accounts',
branch: 'if(comparison)'
})

/*

Where select is provided by a database testing context
And callout / branch are covered by whatever test.js.

TODO: as we are live coding write the unit tests and 
  try to break the app with junk/typed/fuzzed data.
