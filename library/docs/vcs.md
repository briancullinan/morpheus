# VCS (Version Control System)

A version control system watches for file changes.
When you make an import change you can store the difference
then look up changes you made in the past.


TODO: show tree-branch (auto branching for glob-paths, tip of the tree visual)
TODO: temporal-merge (syntax aware merging and CI)
TODO: interesting docker file-system, and versioning policy work I did at EPIC
 saved many upset people from losing stuff, bringing joy from recovered work 
 is maybe one of the few perks of the job.
