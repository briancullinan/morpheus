## Performance


TODO: slow the program counter down


## Integrations

TODO: show 3D map of connected systems


# Embedded systems

TODO: intro to IoT and show a button to turn on my 
  sprinkler in the backyard from a web service.

TODO: x86 may soon be way of the past, need a way to
  do the opposite of OBS and show an old computer on
  a new system.
