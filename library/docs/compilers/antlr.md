# Generalized evaluator

## aka ANTLR

Not long ago Github finally solved the Age old Debate for 
software developers; TABs or SPACEs. Enter, the generalized
linter. Finally, no matter if you prefer tabs or spaces, 
Github will automatically convert it for you.

Taking this idea a little further, we have a generalized
evaluator. It can run basic programs in any format as
long as you conform to a few oppinionated rules.




TODO: import anything from rosetta-euler here to demo.

TODO: build all of ANTLR into a WASM and use as language server
have a little download button like Google translate for offline 
mode where it downloads all the languages.

TODO: translate ANTLR tokens to ECMA tree
