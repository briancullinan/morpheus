# Attributes

Similar to publishing, attributes give functions context
of where they are used.

@Before(__func) and @After(__func) attributes 
are provided to get you started.
@Add(__name, __func) and @Remove(__name, __func) 
are also provided to add an remove attributes.

Give it a try!


Special attributes for evaluation symbols are provided.
