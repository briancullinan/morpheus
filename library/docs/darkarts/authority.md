# Authorization

How to establish what a user is allowed to do on a system?


TODO: permissions, ACLs, those are neat to use in Filesystem level.
Microsoft has one that's like 128 bits long, show that here.


TODO: Admining cloud environments with remote-desktop before
they discontinued the multiview, show Cerebro in action here.


TODO: Show a bunch of stuff we aren't authorized for as sort
of a public door knock and run. LOL
