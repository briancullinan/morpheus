# Dissent

Dissent is a powerful hacker tool. While counter-culture
might be defensive, or passive such as petitioning and
visiting town hall meets, maybe even raising an issue.

Dissent is aggressive and offensive. It's sometimes accompanied 
with contempt. It is when a person or community disagrees with
the actions of some governing authority to the extent they
are taking corrective measures into their own hands.

Rioting is an aggressive form protest without corrective action
towards the counter-culture. i.e. "they" thing the riot is
the corrective action to not being heard during protest. There 
is no corrective action in the act of rioting itself. Therefore
rioting is a form of protest, and not a form of dissent.

I.E. The only social position where protesting is the corrective
action for "not being heard" is the Supreme Court. Because, logically
it is a Judge's job (no one else's) to consent or protest. Dissent 
in the form of judgment is being heard in the protest 
(i.e. the documented and artifacted outcome of the court hearing 
is called `dissent`.) Rioting
inside of the Supreme Court could have been the only legitimate
form of `protest` due to the events of September 20, 2015, but that
is not the outcome history deserved.

The problem is, corrective measures from a counter-
culturalist could deviate even more from popular opinion.

TODO: give examples of how cambridge analytica manipulates 
people by promoting companies or politics, then convincing
you that you agree with them because other people you know 
apparently do. i.e. Look at all the great things Johnson and
Johnson is doing by overlooking a history of greed and
negligence because they are paying for Facebook Advertising
(come up with 10 more examples of things people disagree with
like the Onion, except real news!).

TODO: ask a user to sign in to Facebook to share their friends
list over the API. Then generate controversial posts from
their friends in a Mock UI. When they go to comment on 
something the user disagrees with post the comment on the 
real Facebook. The proof is in the puddle, our own program
creates a manipulation that changes a persons behavior, the
fact that our own program was lying to us, decouples the issue
of changing the behavior based on a lie from the social 
network itself, and puts the responsibility on the user.
Hence, they were the ones who initiated it anyways, don't
comment on everything.

TODO: then demonstrate how dissent is used for good. Enter
Banksy.

TODO: show an example of popular opinion that hasn't changed 
for centuries due to the actions of counter-culturalists. show
how the information was used to change doctrine.

TODO: collect positive emotional information from Facebook, offer
continuing consulting services on "company presence" on social
networks. (i.e. my idea for clearing college pictures with red
cups in them using OpenCV.) 

This demonstrates a counter-culture (i.e. see prohibition)
of alcohol being "unbecoming", and a dissentful action by providing
a tool to clean up pictures that advertise alcohol use for free
on Facebook by stealing photos of parties and branding them.
Facebook made that legal, Congress made it legal to steal people's
pictures to make it look like you're advertising for something else.

GDPR apparently doesn't give a fuck about enforcement 
(i.e. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwfPmVzbLO0&t=36s). I found
another guy on Twitter complaining about the exact same thing
it's probably in my conversation records.
