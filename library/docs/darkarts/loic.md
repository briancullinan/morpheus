# LOIC (Low orbiting ion cannon)

Like many hacking projects (including this one) they
are inspired. In one stroke of inspiration the cannon
was born. The digital form of blowing up a website from
space with laser beams.

LOIC now accepts bitcoin!

LOIC works by using a pharm of botnets to make requests
to servers to block legitimate user requests or crash them.
It's featured here because many networks have services to
block this sort of attack.
