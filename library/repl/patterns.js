// TODO: undoEval()
// Undo eval converts recognized patterns back into functional templates.
// undo the crap in code bases, i.e. convert $(wildcard )
//   to a list of files, put back into Makefile in 5 lines of declaration.

// TODO: convert mustache templates to pure javascript statements.
//   with the required library code embedded at the top and not the whole thing.

// TODO: undo evil, if a function is authorized for transformation, 
//   execute it in authorized places. i.e. automatically add 
//     htmlspecialchar() to /template/ files, report if zero exist 
//     as a security error tool like they don't know what a sink is!

// TODO: undo /stacks/middleware.js pattern.
