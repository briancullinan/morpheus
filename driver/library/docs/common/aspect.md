# AOP (Aspect oriented programming)

By adding special program statements that run before and
after other parts of our program, we create a new kind of
control structure!  Enter aspects. It's the idea behind 
all middleware, bootstrapping, dependency injection
patterns.

Give it a try!
@Before(__func) and @After(__func)
