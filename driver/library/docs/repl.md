# REPL

REPL stands for Read, Execute, Print Line.
When combined with [eval()](./eval.md) and
a [loop](./eval/loop.md) we can execute 
commands like code.

```
Read ◄──────┐
│           │
▼           │
Execute     │
│           │
▼           │
Print Line ─┘
```

```dialog
{
  "accessor": "_tryItIDE",
}
```
