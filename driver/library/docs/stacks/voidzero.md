# Void Zero (Framework)

Void Zero is the name given to this declarative-
templated framework. Where it is the goal on most 
frameworks to fill in all the gaps, so you don't 
need to rewrite them or "reinvent" the wheel.

This is principally contradictory to itself as we
have all probably used a framework that is easy for
80% of goals, but once you try to get that last 20%
of features in, you end up re-inventing the proverbial
wheel anyways... Monoliths.

Void Zero aims to cure all of that. Normally, when
you write a function, you call that function as a
service from somewhere else in the code. That is not
how Void Zero works best. The goal is to create a hole
for other components to fill. You, the author, must
consider other components, rather than the one you 
are working on.

Here's an example to the right:
