# Test Mock

Mocking service endpoints can help with testing during development.
I've provided a simple proxy service, that loops back to your own
app in a web-worker.

TODO: show how data can change in a mock and then pull data from remote.
TODO: deploy data/graphics demos as a service by injecting drag-drop UX.
