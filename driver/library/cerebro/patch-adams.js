// Get it? software-patch, patch-adams medicine related.

// patch my medical career into a system of memorization
//   and study with the spaced-repition module

// TODO: then patch this system into data systems and 
//   fuck the current insurance system by under-cutting
//   the market with healthy policy holders using a $500
//   marketing loss-leader for massage chairs to help
//   diabetics with blood-flow on their PT-offdays.
// Just like the Thaiwanese (massagers). LOL

// TODO: then purchase and sell insurance companies like candy.

// TODO: I always thought the idea of "we're all in this together"
//   and privacy were in conflict with eachother when it comes
//   to medicine. Expose medical data in a way where the
//   general public can be in competition with each other
//   to fight unhealth norms, i.e. a city wide insurance
//   policy where rules like "NYC soda-pop law" actually 
//   leads to lower taxes because the insurance policy
//   for the city is costing less due to less sugar intake.
