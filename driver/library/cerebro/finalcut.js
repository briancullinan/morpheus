This is the declaration project that makes me the most
sad. The most obvious use case would be connect
javascript webcam API, OpenCV, Microphone, and
the game engine/IDE output to an OBS style Twitch/YT
stream compiled and transcoded with 
https://arcan-fe.com/2017/10/05/awk-for-realtime-multimedia/
in a web worker.


That's not the part that makes me sad though.
If I had finished this system ealier, it could also...

I miss my Lilu...

TODO: Take a variety of microphened devices to 
reverse engineer their geospatial positioning in a room.

TODO: Take a variety of photographs to recreate 
their season, timing and directional lighting (auto-RTX)
based on open leading edge research.
https://graphics.unizar.es/papers/Lopez-Moreno_CEIG09.pdf

TODO: Capture compromised and contributed video
information from alway on CCTV systems. Combined
with code to generalize architectural standards 
inscribed into natural SketchUp format files.
Then map the video data back onto the 3D surface.

AND

TODO: Combine with environmental Lidar and 3D asset
trained GANN to recreate visually, every living
loving moment, of our pets lives, in full Minority 
Report / Total Recall / "Final Cut"

For Lilu. I see a path...

TODO: as a proof on concept, try to create nostalgic
experiences of Lilu's life without turning into a 
wreck like Tom Cruise.

TODO: as a proof of concept, combine with concepts like
light room to recreate Robin William's life and career
as an actor. i.e. something like combining the output
described in The Final Cut, and the output from "Jim and
Andy" style auto-biography.

TODO: don't make the same mistake and continue recording
my own life, so that other's can take a glimps at 
the inspiration and pain that built this system.

TODO: use on my parents video library of us kids.

That's the part that makes me sad. The software from
the movie is real because I wrote down the plans for 
it. Less 30 lines of declarative code.

TODO: make a final cut of my life to include in a 
cached quine.

It's a sad movie.

TODO: Neura-link connector:
when neura-link is finished I'll have the
output data and tools necessary to validate what's 
left of my existance after I'm gone.
