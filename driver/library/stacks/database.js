// TODO: obvious bindings for sqlite, mongo, sql

// TODO: bindings for web like IDBFS, localStorage,
//   cookies, cache.js, window.preFS, FS.virtual,
//   should all be 5 LoC each.

// TODO: bind declarative database to loading code,
//   and make an ORM version of what the RPC code 
//   currently does to OData.json specification files.
//   It makes an in memory module from json, this will
//   be much smaller code now with templates.

// TODO: combine with OpenCV for a basic APT / NPM / CocoaPods
//   dependency graph stored in a database of our choosing, 
//   this could be helpful in build code dependencies on the
//   mock M$ Language Server later. It was also really 
//   convenient to host NPM-cache locally so I don't 
//   have to keep downloading while testing a framework
//   issue. This would give us code access into the Apt
//   system and we could supplement our own loopback / dev
//   dependencies at the protocol level.

// TODO: combine with the rest of my jupter_ops and 
//   Github code databases, but automatically import
//   in a way that is both functional, and stylish.
//   In 5 LoC of course.
