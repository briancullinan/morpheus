/*

automatically searching a directory for blog images
to include is pretty helpful, would be nice if it
showed a whole library like my old media-server project.

would be nicer if I never have to write a gulp or a makefile
ever again. might be cool to make my own version of make using
a syntax modified version on ANTLR prolog and STDIO bindings.

in 10 LoC or less of course.
