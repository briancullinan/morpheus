// If a separate test module is needed, it
//   could only contain (1 - 2) functions with a 
//   declarative list (1..n) of "COMPONENTS" 
//   (not individual functions, entire features / 
//     components are tested and listed in 1 test module, 
//     i.e. ~ 5 - 10 LOC per component, as opposed to per function)
//   with (1 - 2) test environments passed into each component.

// Unit test files becomes a multiplication of 
//   functionality rather that retesting the same branches and primitives.
// TODO: demonstrate seperate unit test file.
