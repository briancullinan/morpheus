Reformed. Ratified. Humble. Hungry. (Where ever I fit in.)

Lived in the fast lane for years. Disregarding the important. Meaningful things in life. I recently decided to take on line course. Just passed my 90 hr. Real estate class. Completely changed my diet.. became grounded. Happy and humble in the process as I lost everything materialistic along the way as buying time to study was more than I thought. I'm currently doing freelance gig work. Studying for my state exam looking for shelter. I have money and make it every day. Can pass background check.

Hello. I'm an older female looking for a place, and I'm in between apartments. It's hard to find an available and affordable place, very hard, so for the time being, I'm sleeping in my suv. I'm in need of a safe and legal place to park and sleep. If anyone knows of a place, let me know. I'm hard working, and this has never happened to me before. I'm willing to pay a reasonable fee to rent a space. Or if you know of other options, let me know. My name is Chris. Thanks :)

Alternate morning work between Surprise and Litchfield (hence location location location) and just landed a night shift near the airport so am on the go and absolutely have to have a clean, safe, and quiet place to be at through the late mornings and afternoons to sleep. I don't need any other privileges if they're not offered. Sleep is my most important priority at the moment.

About me - I'm almost 50 years old, so am not inclined to be around any weirdness or drama of any kind. I don't smoke, drink, or do any drugs of any type. I'm not especially political or religious, but would appreciate the peace and security in a conservative minded home. I'm very clean and have everything I need, so it doesn't matter if it's furnished or not.

Really, if you have a home where people work and it's quiet during the day - that's what I need. My shift starts at 9pm Sunday through Thursday and my morning shift will likely wrap before noon so I can get to sleep. I need it dark and quiet. I'm super clean and quiet and will likely not do more than sleep, as my work schedule keeps me gone and busy.

If you can help on a weekly basis that's preferred as my situation has cost me more money than I've been making between weekly rentals and car repairs. I'd intended on leaving state, but since car problems ate up my cash reserves and the problem's not fixed, I've got to stick around until that's resolved. In the meantime, my focus is the night job - which is why I need a daytime sleeping room.

If you haven't read the whole ad, you probably won't read this - I'll need your direct contact information and cross-streets in the first email or I won't reply. Thank the loads of international spammers out there for that. I simply don't have time for more than a straightforward response from anyone. I'm ready to rent right now by the week from a decent person with a nice quiet home I can rest during the day.

Again - please include your direct contact information and the nearest cross-streets (if not the actual address). Also, I'm looking for weekly, and you should address how you want to handle that in your response as well. I've been looking for a room to rent since a month before the move-out in mention. The lack of legit responses has further complicated my problems. In fact, all I've had are bogus responses... So, if you don't provide the information I've asked for, you won't get a reply.

Thank you for reading!
