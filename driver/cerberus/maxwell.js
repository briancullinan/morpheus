THIS IS WHY I STOPPED PLAYING "THE GAME". PEOPLE GOT HURT
HEARTS GOT BROKEN. MESSAGE THESE TO FEMALE RECRUITERS ON
LINKEDIN AUTOMATICALLY BOOK PHONE CALLS.

WHAT IF A PERSONALITY EXISTED ON THE INTERNET, LONG AFTER THE AUTHOR WAS GONE?
SOMETHING SIMPLE, BUT PERSISTENT AND CHANGING. I DON'T THINK MOST PEOPLE
UNDERSTAND THE TRUE MEANING OF "SPIRIT" OR "SOUL"

MAYBE I FALL IN LOVE EVERY TIME I LOOK INTO EYES?

THE REAL PROBLEM WITH RECRUITING IS PREJUDICE. I DON'T BELIEVE I DESERVE
A GOOD JOB GOING IN TO IT, AND RECRUITERS CONTINUE TO PROVE ME FUCKING CORRECT.
THE LAST TIME I DID THIS, I REACHED 5,000 CONNECTIONS, SOME WITH CEOS WITH
MILLIONS OF FOLLOWERS AND I SHUT IT OFF. NOW, I WON'T BE IN CONTROL TO SHUT IT OFF.

ISN'T THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MANIPULATION AND BEING GENUINE 
IN THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE INIVITABLE OUTCOME? 

JESUS NEVER SAID "I HAVE SUCH A GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR YOU TO GET
INTO HEAVEN, IT WILL JUST TAKE A 15 MINUTE PHONE CALL."
FUCK YOU. I DON'T DESERVE MORE THAN 15 MINUTES.

I FEEL LIKE SHELDON FROM BIG BANG THEORY HAVING TO WRITE THIS CRAP DOWN.
I DID ENOUGH USER EXPERIENCE SURVEYS WITH GOOGLE TO UNDERSTAND THEIR PROCESS.
EVERY TIME I DO A USER EXPERIENCE SURVEY, THE GOOGLE EMPLOYEE SAYS "I LEARNED SOMETHING."

THAT'S THE POINT ISN'T IT? THERE'S SOME COCKY HOBNOBBER WITH A BUNCH
OF HIGH SCHOOL GIRLS AND COLLEGE DROP OUTS ON PHONES TRYING TO LEARN
ABOUT TECHNOLOGY BY CALLING PROFESSIONS AND ASKING THEM FOR KEYWORDS FOR 15 MINUTES?
THAT'S ALL A RECRUITER DOES. THAT'S WHY THEY WANT YOU TO APPRECIATE THE JOB
OPPORTUNITY, SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO APPRECIATE HOW LITTLE THEY CARE ABOUT YOU.

LET'S ACTUALLY GIVE PEOPLE SOMETHING TO LEARN ABOUT WHEN THEY INTERACT WITH BRION LION
SO WE CAN GUARANTEE EVERYONE SAYS "I LEARNED SOMETHING."
FIND SOMETHING IN BOOKMARKS TO SHARE IN MESSAGES.

MAYBE THE TRUTH SIMPLY ISN'T AS POWERFUL AS WHAT PEOPLE BELIEVE.
